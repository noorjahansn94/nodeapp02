## Overview

A concise description of what this Jenkins project is about, its purpose, and its benefits. You can include any relevant context here.

## Prerequisites
1. Kubernetes cluster (K3D used in this project)
2. Helm installed in your machine
3. Docker desktop installed in your machine

## Install Helm

In this lab, you will use Helm to install Jenkins with a stable _chart_.  Helm
is a package manager that makes it easy to configure and deploy Kubernetes
applications.  Once you have Jenkins installed, you'll be able to set up your
CI/CD pipleline.

1. Download and install the helm binary

    ```shell
    wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.2.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

1. Unzip the file to your local system:

    ```shell
    tar zxfv helm-v3.2.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    cp linux-amd64/helm .
    ```

1. Add the official stable repository.

    ```shell
    ./helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
    ```

1. Ensure Helm is properly installed by running the following command. You
   should see version `v3.2.1` appear:

    ```shell
    ./helm version
    ```

    Output (do not copy):

    ```output
    version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.2.1", GitCommit:"fe51cd1e31e6a202cba7dead9552a6d418ded79a", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.10"}
    ```
